It's going to be a surprise. <br/> TINA: Are you going to buy a new car? <br/> MARK: Not now, because our family car is very new, but I'm going to buy a really nice bike for my son, Richy. He loves riding bikes. <br/> TINA: Are you going to buy a new bike for your daughter, too? <br/> MARK: No, she doesn't like bikes. I'm going to buy new furniture for her room. She'll love that."
